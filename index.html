      <section>
        Welcome to Oreo's Cum Drive! Wanna help load up a pup? I'm seeking any
        and all donations I can get!

        <h2>‚ÅâÔ∏è What is this? ‚ÅâÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Pup Oreo, and I'm asking for people on the internet to act
          as donors and send me their cum in the mail! I'm hoping to get as many
          as I can together. Once I have a bunch gathered, I'll mix it all up
          and take videos of me getting as much enjoyment out of it as I can,
          and then share them with everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Donors will get to make special requests about what I do with the
          loads and I'll do my best to make everyone happy. I'll also upload
          donation stats and load counts to this website once donations are
          complete!
        </p>
        <p>
          If donors record videos of them collecting their samples, I'll include
          it in a compilation video I make at the end.

        <h2>‚úÖ FAQ ‚úÖ</h2>
        <ul class="faq">
          <li>
            What should I ship it in?
            <ul>
              <li>
                The simplest thing would be to fill up some condoms, put them in
                a ziploc bag, and mail them! Though if you want to ship me a
                container of cum I'd be a very happy dog.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Do I need to keep the samples cold in shipment?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not particularly. As long as the package gets here in few days
                and the cum was frozen ahead of time, it should be okay.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Won't it get gross on the way?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Maybe, but it'll probably be okay! I'll put it in the freezer
                once it arrives and make sure everything seems okay. If not I
                can inform the donor about the samples not making it.
              </li>
