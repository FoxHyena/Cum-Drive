        <p>
          Hello! I'm Pup Oreo, and I'm asking for people on the internet to act
          as donors and send me their cum in the mail! My goal is to get over
          <u>100 loads</u> in the mail, and I need your help!
        </p>
        <p>
          Once I have donations collected, I'll mix them up, take videos of me
          getting as much enjoyment out of them as I can, and then share them
          with everyone. I'll also upload donation stats and load counts to this
          website once donations are complete!

        <ul class="faq">
          <li>
            What should I ship it in?
            <ul>
              <li>
                The simplest thing would be to fill up some condoms, put them in
                a ziploc bag, and mail them! Though if you want to ship me a
                container of cum I'd be a very happy dog.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Do I need to keep the samples cold in shipment?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not particularly. As long as the package gets here in few days
                and the cum was frozen ahead of time, it should be okay.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Won't it get gross on the way?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Maybe, but it'll probably be okay! I'll put it in the freezer
                once it arrives and make sure everything seems okay. If not I
                can inform the donor about the samples not making it.
