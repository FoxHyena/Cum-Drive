        <p>
          Hello! I'm Pup Oreo, and I'm asking for people on the internet to act
          as donors and send me their cum in the mail. Playing with used
          condoms, saved up cum, and getting filled with as much cum as I can
          get my paws on are huge kinks of mine, and I'd love your help getting
          to indulge in that! My goal is to get over <u>100 loads</u>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the donations are collected I'll mix them up, take videos of me
          getting as much enjoyment out of them as I can, and then share them
          with everyone. I'll also upload donation stats and load counts to this
          website once donations are complete!

        <h2>‚úÖ FAQ ‚úÖ</h2>
        <hr />
        <ul class="faq">
          <li>
            Why do this? Why not just get bred by a bunch of guys instead?
            <ul>
              <li>
                A few reasons: Firstly, playing with used condoms and cum-play
                are huge kinks of mine, separately from getting bred. I'm also
                into the anonymity of taking loads from people online that I've
                never met before. On top of that, this gives me the chance to
                take the loads of people I might not otherwise get a chance to
                play with, and do it in a really hot way. Another big kink of
                mine is marking, and by doing this I'll be getting marked all at
                once by everyone that donates a load, and I find that incredibly
                hot. Aside from those, being a cumdump dog is just one of my
                favorite things üíöüêæ
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            What should I ship it in?
            <ul>
              <li>
                The simplest thing would be to fill up some condoms, put them in
                a ziploc bag, and mail them! Though if you want to ship me a
                container of cum I'd be a very happy dog.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Do I need to keep the samples cold in shipment?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Not particularly. As long as the package gets here in few days
                and the cum was frozen ahead of time, it should be okay.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Won't it get gross on the way?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Maybe, but it'll probably be okay! I'll put it in the freezer
                once it arrives and make sure everything seems okay. If not I
                can inform the donor about the samples not making it.
